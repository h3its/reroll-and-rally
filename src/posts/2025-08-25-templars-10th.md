# Black Templars in 10th — the simplest possible overview

If you like Space Marines who **hate witches**, **love charges**, and win by **being in melee**, welcome home. Black Templars trade Oath of Moment for **Templar Vows**, push **big melee units** up the table, and supercharge them with **support characters**.

Use this post as a **table-side reference**.

---

## TL;DR (At a Glance)

- **No psykers. No Oath of Moment.** You run on **Templar Vows** (pick 1 at the start of round 1).
- **BT + Marine detachments:** You can use most Space Marine detachments (e.g., **Gladius Task Force**). You **can’t** use **1st Company Task Force**.
- **Three Codex BT detachments:**
  - **Companions of Vehemence** – re-roll **Advance** and **Charge** army-wide.
  - **Vindication Task Force** – **objective control** plan; Ancients & Crusaders shine.
  - **Godhammer Assault Force** – **transport assault** (Land Raiders/Repulsors).
- **Game plan:** Choose the right **Vow**, **deliver** your bricks (on foot or in tanks), **layer leaders**, and **trade up** in melee.

---

## Core Rule: Heirs of Sigismund (What You Gain/Lose)

- **Lose:** Oath of Moment; all **Adeptus Astartes Psykers**.
- **Gain:** **Templar Vows** (below).
- **Restrictions/Swaps:** Can’t use 1st Company Task Force; certain datasheets use **Templar versions** (e.g., Sternguard, Terminators, some tanks).

**Good news:** If you pick a non-BT detachment like **Gladius**, you **still** replace Oath with **Vows**.

---

## Templar Vows (pick 1 at the start of round 1)

| Vow | What it does | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| **Accept Any Challenge, No Matter the Odds** | If your **melee S ≤ enemy T**, your attacks get **+1 to wound**. | **Default.** Keeps S4 chainswords relevant; helps into big stuff (Knights, Monsters, bricks). |
| **Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch** | **Re-roll charges vs Psykers**; your melee gains **Precision** vs Psyker units. | When facing **Thousand Sons, Grey Knights**, or psyker-stuffed lists. |
| **Suffer Not the Unclean to Live** | **Fall Back & Charge**; pile-in/consolidate must finish closer to the **unit** (not model). | Movement tricks, chaining combats, tagging problem units. |
| **Uphold the Honour of the Emperor** | **INFANTRY:** **Sticky objectives**; can **perform Actions after Advancing**. | Mission/scenario scoring, action play, board control plans. |

> **Why you won’t miss Oath:** BT datasheets and leaders pack **hit/wound support** (rerolls, crit/ lethal synergies), so your **charges connect** and **melee converts**.

## Detachments (Codex Black Templars)

### Companions of Vehemence — “arrive & fight”
- **Army rule:** **Re-roll Advances and Charges**.
- **Who loves it:** **Crusader blobs** and **Sword Brethren** with Chaplains/Judiciars.
- **Use when:** You want raw **speed** and **charge reliability** without fuss.

### Vindication Task Force — “objective bully”
- **Play pattern:** **Ancients** + **big Infantry** hold/retake ground; tools to survive and score.
- **Use when:** Your plan is **primary pressure** with sticky troops and return-to-fight tricks.

### Godhammer Assault Force — “transport assault”
- **Play pattern:** Roll up in **Land Raiders/Repulsors**, **disembark**, **delete**.
- **Use when:** You own the metal boxes and want the **assault-ramp fantasy**.

> You may also run **Gladius Task Force** (Templars still get **Vows** instead of Oath). You **cannot** use 1st Company Task Force.

---

## Units to Know (roles in one line)

- **Crusader Squads (Primaris):** Big **melee infantry** with **Sustained Hits 1**; when shot, they **surge** toward nearest enemy (once/phase) — tag or slingshot.
- **Sword Brethren:** **Damage 2** power weapons; “bully” mid-board; reactive move when enemies **Fall Back**.
- **Marshal / Castellan:** **Hit/crit/lethal** support; glue that turns bricks into blenders.
- **Emperor’s Champion:** **Character assassin**; fast, durable trick piece that deletes key targets.
- **Execrator (new):** Buff-chaplain for **Crusaders/Sword Brethren**; crucially gives **Advance & Charge**.
- **Crusade Ancient (new):** Can double-up with another Leader; grants **4+ fight-on-death** in melee — insurance for expensive hammers.
- **Templar Sternguard / Terminators:** BT-flavored versions with useful, matchup-agnostic rules.
- **Repulsor Executioner (BT):** Full **hit re-rolls** when shooting targets near your Astartes units; nasty **Overwatch** angles.
- **Land Raider Crusader (BT):** Tunes assaults and target setup for the disembarking unit — centerpiece for Godhammer lists.

---

## How They Play (5-step plan)

1. **Pick the Vow** for the matchup (usually **Accept Any Challenge**).
2. **Choose delivery:** **Foot bricks** (Companions/Vindication) or **tanks** (Godhammer).
3. **Layer leaders:** Marshal/Castellan (hit/crit/lethal), **Execrator** (A&C), **Ancient** (fight-on-death).
4. **Exploit surges:** Use **Crusader surge** when shot to tag, trap, or hop objectives.
5. **Trade up:** Land **multi-charges** with buffs; your **ranged support** (Executioner, Lancer, Ballistus) handles armor.

---

## Loadouts & Combos (quick picks)

- **Hammer Brick:** 10–20 **Crusaders** + **Marshal** + **Castellan** + **Crusade Ancient**. Vow **Accept**; detachment **Companions** for charge reliability.
- **Raid & Blade:** **Sword Brethren** in a **Land Raider** (Godhammer). Add **Execrator** for **Advance & Charge**, then delete.
- **Character Missile:** **Emperor’s Champion** hunts keystones. He forces awkward screens and trades up.
- **Gun Buddy:** **Repulsor Executioner** plays near infantry to unlock **full hit re-rolls** into its target; brutal on **Overwatch**.

## Example 2,000pts — Gladius Task Force (BT Vows active)

> **Why Gladius here?** It’s a powerful, flexible baseline. As Black Templars, you still **replace Oath with a Vow** each game.
