> 🧠 **TL;DR:** *Devastating Wounds* convert qualifying wound rolls into mortal wounds. They ignore saves, don’t spill over to other models, and are especially spicy into elite units with invulnerable saves.

## What are Devastating Wounds?

Devastating Wounds is a keyword that allows **certain weapons to auto-wound and convert their damage into mortal wounds** on a **critical wound roll**.

- Usually this happens on a **wound roll of 6**.
- Some weapons have **`Anti-X`** keywords that expand the critical range against specific targets.

**Example:**  
If a weapon has both **Devastating Wounds** and **`Anti-Monster 4+`**, then **any wound roll of 4+** against a **Monster** is a critical wound → it **auto-wounds** and the damage is dealt as **mortal wounds**.

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Mortal wounds **ignore normal and invulnerable saves**, making them a powerful way to punch through tough units.

## How do Devastating Wounds work?

Key points to keep straight:

- **Count as mortal wounds.** Any abilities that let you roll “feel no pain”/**ignore-wounds** against **mortal wounds** will apply here.
- **No spillover.** If your weapon is Damage 2 and you score a single Devastating Wound into a **1-wound** model, you kill **one** model; the extra mortal wound **doesn’t transfer** to another.
- **Resolution timing.** Damage from Devastating Wounds is **not applied until the attacking unit has finished making all its other attacks**. Do your full unit’s attacks first, then apply the Devastating Wounds.

> ⚠️ **Gotcha:** Treat Devastating Wounds just like normal damage in terms of allocation (one model at a time), **except** you skip saves because they’re mortal wounds.

## When should you use Devastating Wounds?

They’re best into **elite targets** with strong saves:

- **Great vs:** Terminators, Sanguinary Guard, characters, units with 2+ / 4++ profiles.
- **Why:** You **ignore invulnerable saves**, ensuring damage connects.
- **Even better with:** `Anti-X` abilities or **wound re-rolls**, and any stratagems/leaders that **grant** Devastating Wounds to a unit’s attacks.

## Quick Reference

| Interaction | How it works |
|---|---|
| Saves | **Ignored** (they’re mortal wounds). |
| Feel No Pain / Ignore Wounds vs Mortal Wounds | **Applies** to Devastating Wounds. |
| Spillover | **No** — extra damage does not carry to another model. |
| Timing | **Apply after** resolving the rest of the unit’s attacks. |

## Example Scenario

> **Weapon:** Damage 2, Devastating Wounds, `Anti-Monster 4+`  
> **Target:** Monster unit (3 models, 10W each)

1. You roll to wound; any **4+** counts as a **critical wound** vs a Monster.
2. Each critical wound becomes **2 mortal wounds**.  
3. Mortal wounds **ignore saves**; the Monster unit can only use abilities that work **against mortal wounds** (if any).
4. You **finish all other attacks** from the firing unit first, then **apply** the banked Devastating Wounds.

## Closing Thoughts

Devastating Wounds **reward clever target selection**. Aim them at elite units with strong saves or units where skipping the save step swings the math **heavily** in your favor. Pair with `Anti-X` and wound re-rolls to **maximize** your chance of landing critical wounds.
