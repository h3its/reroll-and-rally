# Adeptus Custodes — Overview

Custodes are the personal guards of the Emperor, created using the Emperor’s own genetics, they are the peak of mortal human capabilities. The Custodian Guard are considered the right hand of the Emperor. Meanwhile, the Sisters of Silence are considered his left. An all women group of "Blanks" capable of blocking out all psychic powers in a radius around themselves. They are recruited specifically by the Emperor to combat any psychic threats to the imperium.

## Army Rule

### Martial Ka’tah
Choose either **lethal hits** or **sustained hits 1** for melee weapons every time a unit is selected to fight.

---

## Detachments

### Shield Host
- **Rule:** Pick one each battle round:  
  - Crit on 5 or 6  
  - or +1 AP  
- **Thoughts:** Simple yet strong , no constraints, best option for starting out while you get comfortable with the game and the army.

### Lions of the Emperor
- **Rule:** +1 to hit and wound when no other friendly units are within 6 inches  
- **Thoughts:** Second best detachment rule, arguably stronger than shield host but requires positioning for buffs, would recommend switching to this one after a few games.

### Auric Champions
- **Rule:** Pick a enemy unit, get +1 to wound for the battle round  
- **Thoughts:** Decent rule, not as strong as the others but doesn't have any constraints, don't see any reason to pick this over one of the better ones.

### Talons of the Emperor
- **Rule:**  
  - Custodes get 5+ FNP against mortals and psychic attacks when within 6 inches of a sisters unit  
  - Sisters get +1 to hit when within 6 inches of custodes unit
- **Thoughts:** Decent detachment, really good if you have a lot of sisters.

### Null Maiden Vigil
- **Rule:** If enemy is within 12 inch of sisters unit AND either a psyker or below starting strength, they need to take a battleshock test. If they are below half, subtract 1 from that test.
- **Thoughts:** This detachment seems like complete booty, battleshocks are unreliable and sisters on their own aren’t that great anyway. Some have managed to find success with this detachment though, so its not completely useless.

### Solar Spearhead
- **Rule:** Custodes vehicles get buffs depending on how many wounds they have lost  
  - Starting strength (no lost wounds): +2 to OC  
  - Below starting strength: Reroll 1s to hit  
  - Below half strength: Reroll 1s to hit and wound
- **Thoughts:** Really good detachment if you have the grav tanks and dreadnoughts to go with it.

# Units

  ---

  ## Epic Heroes

    - **Aleya**  
      - Leads any sisters unit  
      - FNP 5+ (3+ vs mortals or psychic)  
      - Scout 6  
      - When leading a unit gives them fights first  
      - When leading a unit +1 to hit when attacking a unit under starting strength and +1 to wound if unit is below half strength  
      **Thoughts:** Great leader to buff sisters and make them a very scary threat, borderline auto include if you are going heavy into sisters, but otherwise not necessary as sisters are mostly there to perform actions and screen.

    - **Trajann Valoris**  
      - Can lead wardens or guard  
      - Has deep strike and FNP 5+  
      - When leading a unit, that unit can ignore any or all modifiers to hit roll or BS/WS  
      - Once per battle can choose to either give his melee weapon 12 attacks or give himself a 2+ invuln for that phase only  
      **Thoughts:** Not a bad unit per se, doesn’t give any super meaningful buffs to his unit, but his once per battle ability can be very strong. Lions of the Emperor allow you to use his ability a second time which makes him very good, otherwise there are other leaders who give better buffs.

    - **Valerian**  
      - Can lead wardens or guard  
      - Has deep strike and FNP 6+  
      - When leading a unit, can subtract 1 ap from incoming melee attacks  
      - Once per battle can change a single hit, wound or saving throw to an unmodified 6  
      **Thoughts:** Decent model, -1 ap in melee can be pretty handy in certain scenarios, the once per battle dice manipulation is pretty niche and might only make a difference in a game every so often, still would say there are better models to lead these units.

  ## Characters

    Blade Champion 
      - Can lead wardens or guard  
      - Has deep strike  
      - When leading a unit, can reroll charge rolls  
      - Once per battle can allow their unit to advance and charge  
      **Thoughts:** Remember when I said there were better models to lead guard and wardens? Well here we go, reroll charge rolls for units that desperately want to get in melee is very good especially considering their low movement, plus giving once per game advance and charge is really good since you only realistically need to do it once and then your in the middle of everything, just the way custodes like it, arguably a must take in every list, possibly even taking multiple of them, they are even a decent option to run by themselves since they can still benefit from the advance and charge without leading a unit.

    Knight Centura  
      - Can lead any of the sister units  
      - When leading a unit, gives +2 to move, advance, and charge rolls  
      - Has 3+ FNP against against psychic and mortal wounds  
      - Forces a desperate escape test when unit falls back from her  
      **Thoughts:** Seems decent, the bonus to movement helps get the sisters where they need to be for secondaries, screening etc, probably wouldn’t prioritize taking her for same reason as other sister units, not worth the added points.

    Shield Captain
      - Can lead guard or wardens  
      - Once per battle can give unit both lethal and sustained instead of picking one  
      - Can reduce cost of strat by 1 once per battle round  
      **Thoughts:** Very good leader for guard and wardens, allowing you to have both lethal and sustained gives you a huge boost for your go turn, having a cp reduction ability also greatly helps to buff the unit on crucial fights.

     Captain in Allarus Terminator Armor  
      - Can lead allarus custodians  
      - Once per battle can reduce all dmg received for this model to 1 for the phase  
      - Once per round can reduce cp of strat targeting this unit by 1 cp  
      **Thoughts:** Good leader for allarus custodians, can allow you to rapid ingress them for free which can be very helpful when playing a cp hungry detachment.

    Shield Captain on Dawneagle Jetbike  
      - Can lead vertus praetors  
      - Once per round can reduce cost of strat targeting this unit by 1 cp  
      - Once per battle, at the end of the fight phase you can make a fallback move with this unit, or a normal move if they arent in engagement range  
      **Thoughts:** Seems fine as a leader, the reducing cost of stratagems can be nice, but the move at the end of the fight phase is very niche, if this unit gave a damage or defensive buff it would be better but alas, this is what we got.

  ## Battleline

    Custodian Guard 
      - Only battleline unit  
      - Can reroll wounds rolls of 1, full reroll wound rolls when within range of an objective marker  
      - Once per battle can shoot again during the shooting phase  
      **Thoughts:** The only battleline unit in custodes, guard are often overshadowed by the more elite custodian wardens, however guard are a viable option to fill out the core of your army considering the lower point costs and ability to take up to 6 units.

  ---

  ## Dedicated Transports

    Anathema Psykana Rhino 
      - Has a transport capacity of 12 sisters models  
      - Has a 3+ feel no pain against psychic and mortal wounds  
      - Regains 1 wound at start of command phase  
      **Thoughts:** This transport doesn’t see much play, most sisters units are used to do secondaries or screen for your custodes, so having a transport for them is a waste of points that could be better spent elsewhere, potentially useful in all sisters lists.

  ---

  ## Other Units (Custodes Infantry & Elites)

    Allarus Custodians  
      - Deep strike  
      - Can reroll wound rolls against monsters and vehicles  
      - Once per battle can be removed from table and put into strategic reserves  
      **Thoughts:** Custodian terminators, this unit is very useful for dropping into opponents backfield and being annoying and hard to kill, can also be used as missiles to send into monsters and vehicles due to their wound rerolls, highly recommend at least 1 unit of these guys in your list.

    Custodian Wardens  
      - Can subtract 1 from wound roll when attacker has higher strength than the wardens toughness  
      - Once per battle at the start of the phase can give wardens a 4+ feel no pain  
      **Thoughts:** The much tougher brothers to custodian guard, wardens are elite at standing on objectives and never dying, their 4+ feel no pain ability is a bit awkward since you must declare at the start of the phase, allowing your opponent to select a different unit to attack. Most lists run some combination of guard and wardens, the breakdown is up to personal choice.

  ---

  ## Other Units (Sisters of Silence)

    Prosecutors 
      - Have 3+ Feel no pain against psychic and mortal wounds  
      - When making a ranged attack against a psyker unit, gain the precision and dev wounds keywords  
      **Thoughts:** Their abilities are relatively niche considering the lack of psychic in the game at the moment, can have its uses but will mostly be used as scoring pieces.

    Vigilators 
      - 3+ feel no pain against psychic and mortal wounds  
      - Subtract 1 from melee hit rolls against this unit  
      **Thoughts:** Another sister unit, this one is better in melee, same deal, usually most useful as a scoring pieces but they could see more uses in the sisters detachment.

    Witchseekers  
      - 3+ feel no pain against psychic and mortal wounds  
      - Can select one enemy unit hit by a ranged attack from this unit, that enemy unit has to take a battleshock test  
      **Thoughts:** Yet another sisters unit, battleshock tests are very unreliable unless they make you subtract from the test. Honestly pick the cheapest sisters unit and take 2 or 3 of them for scoring and never think about it again.

  ---

  ## Other Units (Vehicles & Dreadnoughts)

    Venerable Contemptor Dreadnought  
      - When this model is destroyed, on a 2+ u can return the model to the table where it was when it died with d6 wounds remaining  
      **Thoughts:** Decent dreadnought chassis, very good unit in solar spearhead with all the vehicles buff, otherwise their is better options for your points.

    Venerable Land Raider 
      - Can transport up to 6 custodes models  
      Unit is eligible to charge after disembarking even if land raider made a normal move  
      **Thoughts:** This unit has potential to be very strong, the only thing really holding it back is the transport capacity, costing 220 points to safely transport a single unit of custodians is not often worth it, however I can see some fun uses for it if you want to get creative.

    Vertus Praetors 
      - Auto advance 6 inches  
      If this unit moved over an enemy unit during the movement phase, roll a d6 per model in this unit, for each 2+ the enemy unit takes 2 mortal wounds  
      **Thoughts:** Decent anti tank unit, can do nice chip damage with the mortal wound ability, overall a pretty fun unit, not a bad idea to have 1 unit in your list.

  ## Forge World (Grouped)

    *Disclaimer: Forge World units are 3rd party units that are considered legal to use in GW run events, however, forge world units have been slowly removed from the game over the last few years. I would caution against buying any of these models due to the likelihood of them being removed in the near future. You can do what you like with your own money, just don't say I didn’t warn you.*

    ### Forge World Infantry & Jetbikes

    Agamatus Custodians
      - Auto advance 6 inches  
      - Can move 6 inches after shooting, can not charge or end in engagement range  
      **Thoughts:** I’ll be honest I’ve never seen this unit in my life, but between the 12 inch move with the auto advance 6 and the move shoot move they seem decent as fast scoring pieces, however the point cost makes them a hard sell over something cheaper like sisters.

    Aquilon Custodians  
      - Reroll wound rolls of 1 when targeting the closest eligible unit with a ranged attack  
      - Once per battle can remove this unit from the table and put them into strategic reserves  
      **Thoughts:** Damage buff isn’t the best since you only reroll 1s, can be useful with the uppy downy ability but once again, there are better options that do this role better like allarus custodians.

    Custodian Guard with special spears 
      - Can reroll wound rolls of 1, or full reroll wounds rolls when standing on an objective you control  
      - Once per battle can give this unit lethal hits and ignores cover on their ranged attacks  
      **Thoughts:** Have never seen anyone run this unit, since other units can fill the anti elite/ anti tank role better. If you truly want to try them out just proxy your regular guards as these guys, I would highly advise against buying these models.

    Venatari Custodians 
      - Fall back, shoot and charge  
      - Can rapid ingress for free once per battle  
      **Thoughts:** Another nice deep strike threat, not as durable or hard hitting as allarus, but have more movement and an inbuilt free rapid ingress to make up for it, can run either and both are viable.

    ### Forge World Vehicles & Dreadnoughts

    Ares Gunship  
      - Can choose one enemy unit the gunship flew over, that unit cannot gain the benefit of cover, also roll a d6 for each model in the enemy unit, each 6+ deals 1 mortal wound to that unit  
      **Thoughts:** So atleast as of writing this article aircraft are mostly terrible and the Ares gunship is no exception, however its hard to deny its an awesome model so no shame in running it, just don’t expect much.

    Caladius Grav-Tank 
      - When targeting non monster/ vehicle units with the lower strength weapon, gain lethal hits, when attacking a monster or vehicle with the higher strength weapon, gain lethal hits.  
      **Thoughts:** This unit is borderline essential in every custodes list. The biggest weakness of custodes is they have limited ranged options and limited anti-tank, this unit shores up both of those weaknesses, highly recommend running at least 1 of these in your lists.

    Contemptor-Achillus Dreadnought  
      - Mortal wound bomb at start of fight phase, gain +2 to roll if this unit charged this turn.  
      **Thoughts:** Not sure if I’ve ever seen this unit on the tabletop, seems decent in the solar spearhead detachment but even then it is competing with a bunch of other dreadnoughts that seem to be better at specific roles.

    Contemptor-Galatus Dreadnought 
      - Subtract 1 from wound rolls when attacked by melee weapons  
      **Thoughts:** So I’m not really sure what the point of this model is, sure its slightly more tanky than the other basic dreads but its profile doesn’t have much to be desired, once again only worth considering in solar spearhead.

    Coronus Grav-Carrier  
      - Can transport up to 8 custodes infantry models  
      - Units that disembark from this transport can full reroll wound rolls against an enemy unit that was hit by a ranged attack from this transport for this turn  
      **Thoughts:** Honestly this transport doesn’t seem half bad, would probably run this over the land raider, however I rarely see custodes using transports due to how expensive everything in this army is.

    Orion Assault Dropship 
      - Can transport 12 custodes infantry, or 6 custodes infantry and 1 basic dreadnought  
      - When a unit disembarks from this transport they are eligible to advance and charge for this turn only  
      **Thoughts:** Similar to the Ares gunship this model will probably never be meta, but damn if its not super cool. Also who doesn’t want to drop a dreadnought out of a gunship and advance and charge it into some unsuspecting spacemarines?

    Pallas Grav-Attack 
      - When shooting at an enemy unit below half strength, +1 to the wound roll  
      **Thoughts:** Never heard of or seen this unit before, collect it if you like the model but don’t expect this to ever be good or usable.

    Sagitarrum Custodians 
      - When shooting into an enemy unit that isn’t a monster or vehicle, if you successfully hit the enemy unit they are suppressed as long as this unit is on the table. Suppressed units have -1 to their hit rolls.  
      - Once per battle can give this unit dev wounds on their ranged attacks  
      **Thoughts:** Another unit I have never seen used, can have one really good turn with the dev wounds, but are otherwise very mediocre for the points.

    Telemon Heavy Dreadnought
      - Subtract 1 from damage characteristic of incoming attacks  
      - Can add 2 to attack characteristic of telemon caestus weapons if equipped with 2 of them.  
      **Thoughts:** This is the big beefy dread you run multiple of in solar spearhead. This model is infamously hard to kill and can hit ridiculously hard. Would usually only consider this unit in solar spearhead but could see running one in other detachments.
