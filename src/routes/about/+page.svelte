  <h1>About the Blog</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome, commander. This blog is a digital battlefield for Warhammer enthusiasts — whether you’re rolling dice with Astra Militarum, charging with Tyranids, or optimizing your T’au battle suits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here you’ll find hobby guides, tactics breakdowns, campaign logs, painting tips, and deep dives into the grimdark lore of the 41st millennium and beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s written by players, for players — part narrative, part theorycraft, and part hobby diary. Whether you're a veteran of the tabletop or just prepping your first Kill Team, there’s something here for you.
